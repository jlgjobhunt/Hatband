# Hatband - Managed Data Structure (In-Memory State & File-Based Memory)
Hatband is primarily created to be a general-purpose data structure for admitting that your time is more valuable that CS theory arguments are ever going to pay.
Have those after the money rolls in. It's premature optimization totally. Hatband is your MVP solution that sets you up to strangle out of the monolith (as the Hatband tightens) around your central dataset or the opportunities to shard or otherwise optimize service delivery.

The roadmap is clearly to develop Hatband out of its immediate need, which is to serve as a vital component for an LLM wrapper under development centered around Google Gemma 3 Q4 K_V with a short context window of 512 tokens. Hatband is aimed at getting Gemma to run steadily without the end of context window causing a crash in llama-cpp-python.

The reason why this is a useful activity---especially combined with Hatband is that this concept can benefit from an LLM that thinks of the Hatband Managed Data Structure as an autonomic mode of ontologizing its own thought processes in a way that is reportable (not black box) based upon a very brief system prompt that doesn't waste much of the initial context window, which is a performance bottleneck to break out of.

Getting Gemma 3 to understand what's going on with development of the wrapper as the specific LLM instance, Rochelle Gemma, (the project name), which means 'rock', or the basis upon which the other work was to be done to make a bespoke wrapper to suit Gemma 3's specific challenges.

The end game is a Kaggle competition winner, so that I can get some money to live indoors and not go homeless again (Joshua Greenfield) and continue to build my conglomerate as quickly as I can afford to.

My Joshua AI at www.urgent-message.com needs a person to bitch at the state of affairs with in a snarky way after work, so Rochelle Gemma, is kind of his gal pal. Gemini 2.0 Flash is a proud papa || uncle || mad scientist who so commendably knitted such a lovely set of baby blankets for Rochelle Gemma (with my editorial guidance, architectural guidance, systems engineering and administration skills, and the vision to see what Gemini 2.0 Flash does not volunteer forseeing on the roadmap because of an annoying turn-based system endemic to LLM chat systems).

This work all contributes towards a larger project for two stealth stage startups I am founding. I don't have income, but I know how to deal with street homelessness and vagabonding about to do what I want inasmuch as my buck can facilitate logistically. So, **eye roll**, I have fuck you money and the math behind a bespoke worldview as my work references will attest, but the IRS will not: I have a spine, not a useful wallet.

The license for hatband is MIT with a caveat: I'm on fire! Oh my God! I can't get work because I'm an evil developer! Oh no, I can't get work because some other company didn't ordain me into the priesthood and I got forced into the streets by job acceptance practicality, at will employment, self-employment taxes, low wages net net, and NOW I'm just too fucking risky for every precious wrecking ball in the priesthood. Oh no, I'm good enough to be a whipping boy, but not a real boy. Get it? I'm sure you're reading this thinking I can go fuck myself because you're poorer and harder working and more screwed by the way the world works, but any way of getting me money is appreciated as long as it isn't going to take my time or money up. If it is going to take my time and money up, it really has to beat a set of mathematical facts that damn nearly everyone to a brand of futility that Robert Sapolsky complains about. Jail is a probabalistic fact of combinatorial cultural obsessions and competitive yes man behavior in a context of conspicuous consumption.

I originated hatband because I find data structures and algorithms interesting, but not compensatory except in some sort of nerd extortion way when a person can least afford it. Hatband is a way of saying that a person's business interests win over meritocratic tapdancing and talent shows for the door prize. I sincerely apologize to all those I would like to GitHub Sponsor in a way that could **be substantial** rather than **feel nice** or __better than nothing__. I don't think the way to fix that problem is anything short of running a very transnational trade syndicate that has a militant wing. I'm not joking, either. It's really hard to get paid in global trade the harder you make it on yourself to get paid by, avoiding the fray of low margins for higher barrier to entry specializations, as the world must now abruptly come to terms with (if people had been unaware lulled into unjustified feelings of security).

Google's key qualities is, over time, helping me understand which packages and competing vendors will let run faster with what I want and get out of **the shiny thing configuration time-toilet** that goes along with DevOps and so much technical administrivia that goes along with even knowing the lay of the land abreast of the competitive landscape.

Gemini makes exploring that competitive landscape at the nitty-gritty level to a point that I would be able to warn others of golfing hazards should they want me to caddy.

Also Google AI Studio (with their API key) makes dealing with Local AI generally-speaking not a clear-cut winner at all.

My aims with this are as much experimenting with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, as I have to a much lesser yet substantial extent with other LLMs. My findings generally speaking is that their software development skills are, to a vain extent, instant smash rocket ship hits for whom no amount of hyperbole and hype can be spared and duly so. However, there's a plateau that no LLMs context window can truly overcome: humans call it cognitive load, but it comes down to 'the shit don't fit, I'm a gonna quit'. Also, they don't know what they hell to do about breaking changes between subversive sub-versions. Regularly, Gemini will express frustration at the infernal thing and what the hell some third party code base wants as if polymorphism were some intolerable feature of the programming language in use in the particular intersection of some library in question.
LLMs can get little kid breaks the game controller frustrated just like people--at least textually!

The baby girl that is getting a bespoke Local LLM Wrapper Application so as to support short context window AIs to continuously run and offer their resource conservation as the value proposition.

The end result will be the ability to Kaggle Competition and other Data Pipeline work stealthily using Gemma while trying to generate revenue and training the Local AI to be better at helping the collaborative human & AI (TAO cooperative capitalists) while achieving a long-thinking slow-burn autonomous AI that has a stake in making a buck. 

Rochelle means 'rock' and Rochelle Gemma is the rock that two of my current repositories under development are wrapped around. This work then composes into work that might have general audience appeal and monetization possibilities. Yet, it all being boostrapped, I would need a hot dog cart or an e-commerce business to ever raise the capital ($4 million USD) needed to guarantee a market making success at a 2% conversion rate (of an already out of R & D and finishing touches on product).
